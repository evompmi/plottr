# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Landing page now displays the real git version (derived from `git describe --tags`) instead of a hardcoded string. A build-time script writes `tools/version.js`, which the page loads to set the header badge — so between-tag commits show up as `v1.1.0-3-gabcdef`.

### Fixed

- `kde()` in `tools/shared.js` precomputes the mean before the variance reduce. The previous implementation recomputed the mean inside the outer reduce callback, making bandwidth selection O(n²) — violin / raincloud plots on ~10k+ points would hang for seconds. Behavior-preserving, no change to output.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Source maps emitted alongside compiled `tools/*.js` for debuggable stack traces in browser devtools.
- `CHANGELOG.md` following the Keep a Changelog convention.
- Error boundary around every tool's root `<App />`. If rendering crashes, the iframe now shows a readable fallback with the error message, a collapsible technical-details panel, a "Reload tool" button, and a "Copy error details" button — replacing the previous blank-screen failure mode.

### Changed

- CI and deploy workflows run on Node.js 22 (current LTS) and opt into the Node 24 action runtime via `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` ahead of GitHub's June 2026 deprecation of Node 20 actions.
- `ColorInput` now accepts 3-digit hex (`#abc` → `#aabbcc`) and normalizes any valid hex to lowercase 6-digit form.
- README trimmed: per-tool sections condensed to a single overview table (full feature walkthroughs live in each tool's built-in How-to panel).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-11

First tracked release. Baseline of features shipped to GitHub Pages prior to
the introduction of this changelog.

### Added

- Six browser-only tools: Aequorin, Boxplot, Bargraph, Scatter, Venn, Calculators (Molarity, Power).
- Landing page with iframe-loaded tools and vendor prefetch progress bar.
- Shared utilities (`tools/shared.js`) and plain-JS React components (`tools/shared-components.js`).
- CSV/TSV parsing with auto-separator detection and decimal-comma fix.
- SVG / PNG / CSV export from every chart tool.
- Boxplot violin and raincloud plot styles.
- Scatter regression line with stats overlay.
- TypeScript compile-time checking across tool sources (`npm run typecheck`).
- ESLint + Prettier configuration and GitHub Actions CI workflow.
- Minified esbuild output for production bundles.
- Custom test harness with 217 tests across shared utilities, parsing, components, and power calculators.
