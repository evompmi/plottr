## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **Line Plot's X / Y min & max now round to 2 decimals and step by 0.1** — the auto-computed axis bounds that pre-fill all four axis inputs were rounded to 4 decimals, which produced noisy readouts like `0.3724` for typical physiological data. Three changes applied symmetrically to X min / X max / Y min / Y max: (1) the auto path now rounds to 2 decimals; (2) the onChange handler also rounds to 2 decimals so typing, pasting, or stepping can never leak float artefacts like `0.30000000000000004` into state; (3) the +/− buttons now step by `0.1` (was `1`) so adjusting the axis walks the first decimal instead of jumping whole units — a typical lineplot range is a fraction of a unit, so stepping by 1 always over-shoots the visible data.

### Fixed

- **Error-bar whiskers on bar charts no longer extend past the axis frame** — in Group Plot (bar style) and Aequorin (inset barplot) auto-y mode, when the lower whisker (`mean − err`) dropped below the baseline (typically 0), the line kept drawing down into the x-axis tick labels. Two changes: (1) Group Plot's auto-y calculation no longer extends `yMin` to include `mean − err`; it only extends for actually-negative means or data points, so bars stay anchored at 0 by default (matches Aequorin's existing behavior). (2) Both tools now clip the whisker to `[yMin, yMax]` in data-space before projecting to pixels, and drop the end-cap on a clipped end (matplotlib / `coord_cartesian` convention) so the truncation is visible — the line remains but the cap disappears, signalling that the error extends beyond the plot range.

### Added

- **Error-bar type called out in the on-plot stats summary for barplots** — when "Print summary below plot" is on and the plot is a barplot, the summary gains a fifth line reading `Error bars: None / SD / SEM / 95% CI` that mirrors the current error-bar selector. Applies to Group Plot in bar style (across flat, subgroup, and facet modes) and to Aequorin's inset barplot (which is always a bar chart, so it always shows). Other Group Plot styles (box / violin / raincloud) don't have an error-bar selector, so the line is suppressed there to avoid implying one.
- **"None" error-bar option on Group Plot barplot** — the Group Plot (bar style) error-bar selector now reads `None / SEM / SD / 95% CI`, matching Aequorin's inset barplot. Picking "None" suppresses the three whisker lines, drops the error-bar stroke-width slider (nothing to style), and removes the error term from each bar's aria-label. The auto y-axis path treats the error magnitude as `0` in this case so bars no longer reserve headroom for whiskers that won't render.
- **SEM and 95% CI columns in Groups tables, TXT exports, and R-script descriptive stats** — the expanded Groups table in every stats tile (Group Plot, Aequorin, Line Plot) now shows `SEM` and `95% CI` alongside `Mean` and `SD`; the half-width is `tinv(0.975, n − 1) · SEM` and displays as `—` when `n ≤ 1`. The ⬇ TXT export for each tool appends `SEM=… , 95% CI=…` to every group's descriptive line so the downloaded summary matches what's on screen. The ⬇ R export now prints a descriptive-statistics block (n / mean / sd / sem / ci95 via `qt(0.975, n-1)`) before the Assumptions section, so users cross-checking against R get the same five columns.
- **95% CI error bars for Group Plot barplot and Aequorin inset barplot** — the error-bar type selector in Group Plot (bar style) and Aequorin (inset barplot) gained a third option alongside SEM / SD. CI half-width is `tinv(0.975, n − 1) · SEM` (two-sided t-critical × standard error of the mean), matching Line Plot's per-x CI definition at `lineplot.tsx:86`. The value is computed once in `computeStats` (`shared.js`) as an extra `ci95` field on every group's stats object, so anything reading `g.stats.ci95` anywhere in the codebase gets it for free. Falls back to `0` when `n < 2`. Aequorin's selector now reads `None / SEM / SD / 95% CI`; Group Plot's reads `SEM / SD / 95% CI`. Aria label on each bar names the active error type. No change to Line Plot (already had this option).

### Changed

- **Internal: stats-state cleanup in Group Plot and setter-pattern cleanup in Aequorin** — follow-up to the flat / facet / subgroup plumbing audit. No user-visible behavior change; reduces the surface area where a future edit could re-introduce the cross-mode leaks that the previous entries in this section fixed. (1) The three summary / annotation stores (flat scalar, facet map, subgroup map) and the three panel-level display preferences (`displayMode` / `showNs` / `showSummary`) used to live as nine separate `useState` hooks on `App`, with their reset semantics spread across `handleStatsShowSummaryChange`, `handleStatsDisplayModeChange`, and `resetDerived`. They are now collapsed into a single `useReducer` (`statsUi`, with a local `statsReducer`) so "mode → none clears annotations", "showSummary → off clears summaries", and "reset clears everything" live next to the state they own rather than in scattered setter adapters. (2) The inline per-subgroup SVG summary block inside `BoxplotChart` was extracted to a `renderSubgroupSummaries` helper, with a shared `statsTextLines` utility used by both that helper and `renderStatsSummary`. (3) Aequorin's `PlotControls` mixed a `sv(key)` curry helper with inline `(e) => updVis({key: …})` handlers; the `sv` helper was dropped and every `onChange` now inlines `(v) => updVis({[key]: v})` to match the event-handler pattern already used for native inputs. No call-site semantics change.

### Added

- **Line Plot tool** — new profile plot for long-format `(x, y, group)` data. Renders one line per group through mean ± error at each shared x-value with error bars (SEM / SD / 95% CI, selectable). Runs per-x statistical tests (`selectTest` routing — t-test / Welch / Mann-Whitney for 2 groups, one-way / Welch / Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA for 3+) with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment across the x-axis; significance stars render above each significant x. Results surface in a single lean summary table — one row per x with test, statistic, p, p (BH), stars — and a single pair of aggregate **↓ TXT** (stitched decision-trace / debugging report across every x) + **↓ R** (runnable script reproducing every per-x test) at the top. Clicking a row expands it inline with slate-banner sections (Groups / Assumptions / Test / Post-hoc / Power) matching the Group Plot stats tile vocabulary. Per-x **test override** lives in the expanded detail (dropdown + "Use recommendation"), and BH adjustment recomputes across the x-axis when any override changes. Per-x **power analysis** (achieved power at α = 0.05 / 0.01 / 0.001 and n for 80 %, driven by observed effect sizes) renders in the Power section of the detail. Stats CSV export, named `<g id="…">` SVG groups for Inkscape, dark-mode aware. Strict numeric equality for "same x" — no tolerance.
- **Horizontal orientation for Group Plot** — checkbox flips all four plot styles to groups-on-y (ggplot2 `coord_flip()`); annotations, grids, and pies rotate to match. Works in combined and faceted views.
- **Subgroup-by for Group Plot** — dropdown partitions groups into subgroups separated by dashed dividers, with stats computed independently per subgroup. Mutually exclusive with faceting.
- **Group Plot configure step requires group + value columns** — the Filter & Rename button is disabled with a warning banner when either role is missing.
- **R-script export from the Statistics tile** — new `⬇ R` chip in Group Plot and Aequorin emits a runnable `.R` reproducing every test the tile ran (Shapiro, Levene, main test, post-hoc) against the current groups. Per-facet in faceted mode. Closes the no-reproducibility-trail gap called out in the README.
- **R-script export from the Power Analysis result card** — same `⬇ R` chip on the computed-result panel emits a `pwr::*` script mirroring the current config, with the solved-for parameter passed as `NULL`.
- **Dark mode** — sun/moon toggle on the landing page and every tool. Follows `prefers-color-scheme` on first visit to a tool (landing defaults to light), persists in `localStorage`, syncs across iframes. Plot cards stay white so exports render identically in any reader.
- **Component CSS classes** — `tools/components.css` adds `dv-panel`, `dv-input`, `dv-label`, `dv-select`, `dv-btn-*`, `dv-num` with proper `:hover` / `:focus-visible` / `:disabled` states.
- **−/+ numeric steppers** — all `<input type="number">` fields now use a compact stepper with press-and-hold repeat, replacing the native browser arrows.
- **Bar outline controls** — unified outline checkbox + width + color across Group Plot (bar style) and Aequorin inset barplot.
- **Named SVG group ids for Inkscape** — chart exports wrap elements in `<g id="...">` groups (`background`, `grid`, `axis-x`, `data-points`, `legend`, `cld-annotations`, …) so Inkscape users can select by name.
- **Logarithmic value axis for Group Plot** — Y scale dropdown (Linear / Log₁₀ / Log₂ / Ln). Visual-only; stats run on raw data. Zero/negative values clamped with a warning. Works with every style, orientation, facet, and subgroup.
- **Export filenames carry the uploaded file's name** — dropping `analysis1.csv` yields `analysis1_groupplot.svg`, `analysis1_venn_membership.csv`, etc. Faceted exports append the facet category.

### Changed

- **Subgroup summary below plot is left-aligned under each subgroup band** — the per-subgroup "Print summary below plot" text previously rendered with `textAnchor="middle"` centered on the band, which made wide summaries overflow into the neighbouring subgroup and the left edge of adjacent blocks drift apart. Each block is now `textAnchor="start"` anchored at the left edge of its subgroup: the plot frame for the first subgroup, the dashed separator line for the rest (same geometry as `subgroup-separators` at `boxplot.tsx:~720`). Reads left-to-right like a caption per subgroup.
- **Fix: only the first subgroup summary rendered on a facet → subgroup switch (and mirror cases)** — React treats the three `BoxplotStatsPanel` call sites as the same component type at the same fragment position, so switching between flat / subgroup / facet modes was reusing the existing panel instance (preserving its `expanded` / `overrides` / `hovered` internal state) rather than unmounting and remounting. When props swapped from a facet-mode `sets` array to a subgroup-mode one, internal memos and the `summaryKey`-keyed `useEffect` fired, but the render-order interaction with the parent state tree left the chart reading a half-populated `subgroupSummaries` (first subgroup emitted, others still missing or overtaken by a stale `facetStatsSummary["_global"]` fallback at `M.left`). Each call site now carries a stable `key` (`"stats-panel-subgroup"` / `"stats-panel-flat"` / `"stats-panel-facet"`) so React unmounts the previous panel and mounts the next one, guaranteeing a fresh mount effect that emits for every set in one pass. Lifted panel-level preferences (Display on plot / Show ns / Print summary below plot) already live on `App`, so the remount doesn't lose user toggles.
- **Fix: stale summary / annotation text reappeared after toggling off in one mode and switching to another** — unchecking "Print summary below plot" in subgroup mode left the first subgroup's summary drawn, and moving from that state to facet mode carried the text over onto facet plots. Same failure mode for "Display on plot" brackets / CLD letters. Root cause: `PlotArea` falls back to `facetStatsSummary["_global"]` (the flat-mode key) as the chart's `statsSummary` prop when no subgroup summaries exist, so a `_global` key emitted during an earlier flat visit kept rendering at the chart's left edge after the user unchecked the toggle; and `facetStatsSummary[category]` entries persisted across mode switches and reappeared on returning to facet mode. Turning a toggle off now wipes every key in `facetStatsSummary` / `subgroupSummaries` (summary) or `facetStatsAnnotations` / `subgroupAnnotSpecs` (annotations), not just the currently-visible set's, so stale cross-mode keys can't fall through anymore. Toggling back on re-emits through the normal `onSummaryForKey` / `onAnnotationForKey` path.
- **Fix: summary below plot dropped on facet ↔ subgroup switch** — switching between facet and subgroup mode (or between subgroup columns) was erasing the per-plot summary text even when the "Print summary below plot" checkbox was still on. The App-level `useEffect(… , [subgroupByCol])` reset `facetStatsSummary` / `subgroupSummaries` on every column change, and a later iteration moved that reset inline into the setter — both variants ran in the same render as the `BoxplotStatsPanel`'s `onSummaryForKey` re-emission and either won the race against it or fought it. Clearing turns out to be unnecessary: the chart only reads keys that exist in the current `facetedData` / `subgroups.subgroups`, so stale keys from a previous column never render. The reset is now gone entirely — switching modes or columns lets the panel's next `useEffect` overwrite the relevant keys in place, so the summary stays drawn across every mode transition.
- **Group Plot stats panel preferences persist across flat / subgroup / facet switches** — the three panel-level controls (`Display on plot` Off/Letters/Brackets, `Show ns`, `Print summary below plot`) used to live as `useState` inside `BoxplotStatsPanel`. Because flat / subgroup / facet mode each rendered a different panel instance, switching modes unmounted the old panel and mounted a new one with defaults, silently resetting all three toggles — most visibly the "Print summary" checkbox, which the user then had to re-enable on every facet/subgroup change. State is now lifted to `App` and passed as controlled props to every `BoxplotStatsPanel` call site, so the preferences survive mode transitions and the summary stays drawn under each plot.
- **"Print summary below plot" is now a lean four-line recap** — the Group Plot and Aequorin chart summary previously mirrored the full stats tile (main test line with statistic / p / stars, every post-hoc pair, effect size, n per group) which duplicated detail already available in the **⬇ TXT** / **⬇ R** downloads. It's now a compact recap of the decision path only: `Normality: yes/no/—`, `Equal variance: yes/no/—`, `Test: <name>`, and (when k > 2) `Post-hoc: <name>`. Normality collapses across groups — `no` if any Shapiro-Wilk group failed, `yes` if at least one passed and none failed, `—` otherwise. Equal variance reads the Levene verdict (`—` when no Levene was run). The summary is meant for traceability on exported charts; precise p-values and per-pair comparisons live in the stats panel and downloads. Line Plot has no such checkbox, so it is unchanged.
- **Per-facet / per-subgroup / per-x stats downloads split into separate files** — the **⬇ TXT** and **⬇ R** buttons in the Group Plot and Line Plot stats panels used to stitch every facet / subgroup / x-point into one combined file, making it hard to keep track of which block belonged to which group. When more than one set is eligible, each now downloads as its own self-contained file named `<stem>_<slug>_stats.txt` / `.R`, with `<slug>` derived from the facet / subgroup label (Group Plot) or the x-value (Line Plot) via `svgSafeId`. Single-set and Aequorin (always one analysis) keep the existing single-file filename. Multi-file downloads fire with a small stagger so browsers don't drop them.
- **Stats-panel row hover uses a navy tint** — the per-row hover background in the Line Plot and Group Plot stats summary tables switches from the near-identical `--surface-sunken` to a new `--row-hover-bg` (soft navy `#d6deef` in light mode, indigo `#2a3766` in dark mode) so it's clearly visible that the row is clickable. Variable lives in `tools/theme.css` and is defined in all three theme blocks (light root, explicit dark, OS-preference dark fallback).
- **Aequorin stats tile redesign** — the `StatsTile` under the Ca²⁺ time-course plot is replaced by the same unified summary-table panel used by Line Plot and Group Plot (`AequorinStatsPanel`). Single row (Aequorin always has one set of groups) with test, statistic, p, stars; clicking expands it inline with slate-banner sections (Groups / Assumptions / Test / Post-hoc / Power) and exposes per-row **test override** (dropdown + "Use recommendation"). **↓ TXT** (decision-trace report) and **↓ R** (runnable reproduction) live at the panel header. Panel-level controls (Display on plot: Off / Letters / Brackets, Show ns, Print summary below plot) drive annotations on the inset barplot and the summary line under the chart, matching the vocabulary users already know from the other tools.
- **Group Plot stats tile redesign** — the per-facet / per-subgroup stack of `StatsTile`s is replaced by a single unified summary table (`BoxplotStatsPanel`) — one row per facet / subgroup with test, statistic, p, stars. A single pair of **↓ TXT** (stitched decision-trace report covering every facet / subgroup) + **↓ R** (runnable script reproducing every test) sits at the panel header, replacing the N pairs the old stack produced. Panel-level controls (Display on plot: Off / Letters / Brackets, Show ns, Print summary below plot) drive the chart's annotations and summary text for every set at once, removing the per-tile toggles that had no shared-chart meaning. Clicking a row expands it inline with slate-banner sections (Groups / Assumptions / Test / Post-hoc / Power) matching the Line Plot vocabulary, including per-row **test override** (dropdown + "Use recommendation"). The flat (no facet, no subgroup) case uses the same panel with a single row that auto-expands, so the visual vocabulary matches the multi-set case. Unlike Line Plot, no Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment is applied across facets / subgroups — tests are treated as independent experiments. The old side-by-side "trio" layout (plot + display tile + summary tile inside one wrapper per facet) is dropped; facet plots now sit in the grid above the unified stats panel.
- **Aequorin plot-page control panel restructured** — sections regrouped (Axes / Labels / Style / Summary barplot), X/Y inputs paired side-by-side, Labels + Style + barplot collapse by default, barplot Show toggle moved to the section header, a11y sweep for real `<label>` elements, Smooth slider gains a `pts` unit, debug column-grouping block removed. Bars now read colour directly from the main conditions — per-condition override dropped.
- **Aequorin control panels are collapsible** — four `PlotControls` sections wrapped in the same disclosure helper boxplot uses, so long condition lists don't overflow the sticky column. Other tools left as-is (fixed control counts).
- **Scatter regression Label position uses mini plot-frame icons** — each corner pill renders a tiny frame with a dot in the matching corner, replacing ↖↗↙↘ arrows.
- **Scatter regression and reference-line checkboxes → Off/On segmented toggles** — consistency pass covering Regression show, Dashed, Show equation, and per-reference-line Dashed.
- **Venn and Aequorin boolean checkboxes → Off/On segmented toggles** — Venn proportional-areas and Aequorin's four inset-barplot booleans now match the boxplot grid toggle.
- **Exclusive selectors across Aequorin / Scatter / Power / Molarity → segmented pills** — consistency pass extending boxplot's pattern. Dropdowns with 5+ options, true booleans, and Molarity's Solve-for column left alone.
- **Bar chart merged into `BoxplotChart`** — the standalone `BarChart` (~400 lines) is now a `plotStyle === "bar"` branch sharing legend, annotation, and facet pipelines. Zero stat regressions.

### Changed

- **Plot tools now reflow on narrow viewports** — dropped the `min-width: 1100px` floor from boxplot, aequorin, scatter, and venn. Previously a 13″ laptop at default zoom forced a horizontal scrollbar across the whole page; now the chrome reflows like the calculator tools do.
- **Landing page follows `prefers-color-scheme` on first visit** — matches every tool's no-FOUC inline script. A dark-OS visitor used to land on a white page, click into a tool, and flip to dark. The landing page now only pins `[data-theme]` when the user has explicitly chosen a theme.
- **Toolbar icon buttons bumped from 32 × 32 → 40 × 40 px** — closer to the WCAG 44 × 44 touch-target guideline, with clearer focus rings. Applies to both the per-tool topbar icons (`.tb-icon-btn`) and the landing-page theme toggle (`.theme-toggle-btn`). Topbar height moved from 46 → 50 px and its left-padding now matches the tool body's 32 px outer padding, so the back-button's left edge lines up with the PageHeader (and every other row) below it.
- **Segmented-toggle pattern extracted into `.dv-seg` / `.dv-seg-btn`** — power and molarity's mode/alpha/power/tails/solveFor/separator pill bars used to re-implement the same inline-styled flex container in every call-site. Now a single CSS class pair in `components.css` owns the active/inactive styling, hover, focus, and disabled states, so a future theme tweak lands in one place.

### Fixed

- **Dark-mode Σ Baseline-corrected toggle dimmed** — the teal `--cta-plot-bg` (`#25a090`) read as glaringly bright against the dark chrome, especially next to the much quieter navy `Σ Raw` pill. Dropped to `#1d7a6d` so the two toggles now read as a matched pair in both themes.
- **Aequorin Y-axis auto-rescale rounds to 2 decimals** — when adjusting the X window, the recomputed `yMin`/`yMax` were writing 10+ decimal floats into the number inputs. Values are now rounded to `X.XX` so the controls stay legible.
- **Scatter regression default colour is a hex literal** — was leaking `var(--danger-text)` into SVG exports (CSS vars don't belong inside charts per CLAUDE.md).
- **Aequorin inset barplot CLD letters now display (#1)** — `InsetBarplot` was reading `annotations.letters`; `StatsTile` emits `labels`. Letters also moved to a fixed row under the plot frame, matching boxplot.
- **Group Plot enforces one `value` column** — configure step was letting users assign `value` to multiple columns; only the first drove the plot. Now demotes prior assignments to `filter`, matching the existing `group` rule.
- **Dark-mode dim fixes across chrome** — Molarity pills + mode cards, `.dv-disclosure` marker, Aequorin Σ Raw/Corrected pills, `.dv-btn-primary` CTA, Power `From my data`/chip toggles, Aequorin Combined/Faceted toggle, and misc. hardcoded hex leaks. All now use themed `--cta-*` / `--step-active-*` / `--accent-warning` variables that dim in dark mode.
- **`tinv` rewritten** — closed forms for df ≤ 2 and Newton-Raphson with Cornish-Fisher seeding for df ≥ 3. Matches R's `qt()` to machine precision even at extreme quantiles where the old pure-bisection `[-50, 50]` bracket silently clamped.
- **Zero-variance guards across stats** — `tTest`, `tukeyHSD`, `gamesHowell`, `oneWayANOVA`, `welchANOVA`, `leveneTest`, `cohenD`, `hedgesG` now return a populated `error` field instead of silently emitting NaN/Infinity on constant input; `shared-stats-tile.js` already surfaces it.
- **`hedgesG` exact gamma-ratio bias correction** — replaces the asymptotic shortcut. Matches R's `effectsize::hedges_g()` at small-n. Docs clarified on `fFromGroupMeans` (uses population-style SD) and `selectTest` (family-wise α inflation).
- **`sampleVariance` → Welford one-pass; `chi2inv` → Newton-Raphson** — Welford is stable under large offsets; `chi2inv` uses Wilson-Hilferty seeding with bisection fallback, matching R's `qchisq()`.
- **`compactLetterDisplay` and `kruskalWallis` degenerate-input guards** — CLD now skips NaN pairs instead of treating them as significant; Kruskal-Wallis all-tied case returns `NaN` + error instead of the misleading `H = 0, p = 1`.
- **Root-finder bracket expansion in `bisect`, `qtukey`, `powerAnova`** — fixed brackets were silently clamping to stale endpoints. All three now expand as needed; `bisect` refuses unbracketed targets.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **StatsTile test assertions** — updated from `el.type === "div"` to `"Fragment"` after the component switched to returning a fragment.
- **Prettier formatting** — reformatted files flagged by `format:check` in CI.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Bar gap control in Group Plot bar style** — 0–80 % slider matching the Box/Violin/Raincloud gap control.
- **Bar width + gap controls in Aequorin inset barplot** — independent sliders for bar width and inter-bar spacing.
- **Show ns toggle for bracket annotations** — when brackets are selected on plot, unchecking Show ns hides non-significant brackets. Absent in CLD mode.

### Changed

- **StatsTile split into two tiles** — "Statistics display" (non-collapsible) holds Display-on-plot / style / Show ns; "Statistics summary" (collapsible) holds Assumptions, Test, Post-hoc, Power, and Download report.
- **Stats-summary SVG print now opt-in** — separate "Print summary below plot" checkbox, unchecked by default, so post-hoc tables don't eat plot space.
- **Plot-page control panels → shared 279 px width** — Group Plot, Aequorin, Scatter, Power (from 328 px); Venn (from 300 px).
- **Dark-mode plot cards dimmed via `filter: brightness(0.85)`** — rendering-only, not serialized into exports.
- **Scatter Color/Size/Shape selectors** dim in dark mode via themed CSS variables.
- **"How to use" tiles** dim in dark mode via four new `--howto-*` variables.
- **Step-nav active pill** dims in dark mode via `--step-active-bg` / `--step-active-border`.
- **Plot frame exported as four named lines** — `plot-frame-top` / `-right` / `-bottom` / `-left` sub-groups so sides can be deleted individually in Inkscape.
- **Venn layout refinement** — iterative circle-position refinement minimising region-area error; a Readability slider blends strict proportionality and balanced layout.
- **Tool top bar redesigned as an icon strip** (`theme-toggle │ home │ <other tools>`) — current tool's icon omitted as the you-are-here marker.
- **Unified download buttons** — single green `⬇ SVG / PNG / CSV / TXT` chip style across all tools.
- **Prominent disclosure indicator** — accent-coloured `>` toggle on collapsible panels, replacing thin unicode carets.
- **"Show ns" off by default** for on-plot significance annotations.
- **Power tool layout** no longer rearranges on narrow viewports — horizontal scroll instead of wrapping.
- **Aequorin inset barplot tile** has a three-state model (hidden / expanded / minimised) with a disclosure toggle; bar, stats, and tile stay mounted across toggles.
- **Aequorin Combined/Faceted toggle** sits as a quiet segmented toggle at the top-right of the plot step.
- **Aequorin "Per replicate" table** is a dedicated tile with a disclosure toggle, collapsed by default.
- **Scatter grid off by default** on new plots.
- **Group Plot rename panel — every group/filter column is reorderable** — drag handles appear on every `group` or `filter` column during the filter step, and per-column orderings are preserved when the column later becomes the primary group or facet.
- **Group Plot enforces a single `group` column** — selecting `group` on a column demotes the previous one to `filter`; previously two `group` assignments were silently allowed.
- **Group Plot stats run per facet** — each facet gets its own `StatsTile`, annotations, and per-facet TXT download. Layout keeps the plot aligned with the summary across facets.
- **StatsTile TXT report named for its context** — `groupplot_stats.txt` / `groupplot_<category>_stats.txt` / `<dataset>_stats.txt`, instead of all writing to `stats_report.txt`.
- **Aequorin plot-step heading** "Plot parameters" → "Time-course parameters".
- **StatsTile disclosure and download** anchored to the header so `⬇ TXT` stays visible when the summary collapses.
- **Landing-page theme toggle** aligned with the rightmost tile of the grid.
- **Aequorin plot step** no longer wraps content in a redundant outer tile.
- **`ActionsPanel` tile title** matches the shared 13 / 600 sidebar heading style.
- **Inward whiskers fixed** — box/violin/raincloud no longer draw whiskers into the box when the interpolated Q3 falls between two points and the larger is an outlier.

### Removed

- **"← Calibration" back button** above Aequorin's plot area (redundant with step navigation).
- **Duplicate theme toggle** inside tool `PageHeader`s — top-bar toggle is the single source of truth.

### Fixed

- **Aequorin plot tiles stayed bright white in dark mode** — outer `ChartTile` / `IntegralTile` now use themed `--surface` / `--border-strong`; the `.dv-plot-card` class moved onto the inner SVG wrappers only.
- **Aequorin Combined/Faceted toggle not responding to clicks** — sticky Sample-selection row was eating clicks; added `width: fit-content` to the sticky wrapper.
- **Aequorin "🔬 Sample selection" overlay showed stale condition names** — now reads edited labels from `conditions` instead of the original CSV headers.
- **Aequorin condition rename lag + stale chart** — split heavy numeric memos from label merges so edits skip the full recompute; added `label` to the `series` memo dep signature so every keystroke updates the legend.
- **Group Plot facet re-render storm** — facet tiles were rebuilding `chartProps` on every parent render. Extracted a memoised `FacetTrio` so each facet only re-renders on its own input changes.
- **Group Plot facet row alignment** — each facet is now its own self-contained wrapper (`--surface-sunken` card). Plot pins to the top, stats display to the bottom; mismatched summary heights stay contained per facet.
- **Aequorin sample selector — unchecking every replicate left the group stuck off** — detecting the forced-off state via `activeColIndices.length === 0` so re-checking a replicate wakes the condition back up.
- **Group Plot facet radio buttons flickered across facets** — per-facet `StatsTile`s shared a hardcoded `name="stats-annot-kind"`, so HTML grouped them as one radio set. Now generated via `React.useId()` per tile instance.
- **Venn region click target** now matches the contoured region — full path, not a ~20 px label circle.
- **Aequorin on-plot annotation ink** matches boxplot's `#222`.
- **Group Plot bar style — "Color by" point colours** — jittered points now pick up the category colour instead of the group shade.
- **Benchmark page theme** stays in sync across tabs, `file://` origins, and bfcache restores.
- **Power tool premature horizontal scrollbar** — removed inherited `min-width: 1100px`.
- **Venn and Power horizontal offset** normalised so `PageHeader` icons align with the top-bar strip.
- **Top-bar theme toggle** now `postMessage`s into iframes instead of relying on the unreliable same-window `storage` event.
- **Venn exports rendered as black blobs in Inkscape** — click-hit circles used `fill="transparent"` (HTML/CSS-only). Swapped to `fill="none" pointer-events="all"`.
- **Aequorin faceted time-course over-dimmed in dark mode** — nested `.dv-plot-card` compounded `filter: brightness()`. Added a `.dv-plot-card .dv-plot-card { filter: none }` override.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Load example dataset link** — in bargraph and boxplot upload panels. Drops in a seeded Arabidopsis dataset (72 rows: 3 × 3 × 8 long format) so new users exercise column roles, filters, facets, and ANOVA + Tukey in one click.
- **`tools/stats.js`** — new plain-JS module hosting distribution functions, `bisect`, sample helpers, normality / equal-variance tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Brown-Forsythe Levene), two-sample and k-sample tests (Student/Welch t, Mann-Whitney U, one-way + Welch ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis), effect sizes (Cohen's d, Hedges' g, η², ε², rank-biserial), post-hocs (Tukey HSD, Games-Howell, Dunn-BH), compact letter display (Piepho 2004), and `selectTest` for the UI's auto-pick. All benchmarked against R at ±5×10⁻³.
- **`StatsTile`** in bargraph and boxplot — collapsible tile running assumption checks, recommending a primary test via `selectTest`, showing post-hoc tables for k ≥ 3, and pushing on-plot annotations (CLD or significance brackets with stacked levels). Hidden for k < 2 or faceted views.
- **Aequorin example dataset** — "Load example dataset" link wired to a real CO7 elicitor time-course (mutant vs WT, calibration at the end). Fetched on click.
- **Aequorin StatsTile** — full analysis tile below the integral barplot, reusing the shared `StatsTile`.
- **Aequorin jitter points** — optional jittered overlay on the integral barplot with color + size controls.
- **Statistical benchmark vs R** — `benchmark/run-r.R` runs 11 tests against built-in R datasets; `benchmark/run.js` reruns them through `stats.js` in a Node VM and emits `benchmark.html` with per-category tables. Failures > 5×10⁻³ render as red rows. Current: 285 comparisons, max |Δ| ≈ 8.2×10⁻⁷.
- **Landing page benchmark link** — replaces the Twain quote with a live test count.

### Changed

- **StatsTile gains a Power analysis section** — observed Cohen's `d` / `f` from the data, achieved power at α = 0.05 (green ≥ 80 %), required n to reach 80 %. Rank tests estimated from parametric analogs, flagged as approximations. Appended to the TXT report.
- **StatsTile gains a "Download report" button** — plain-text export of descriptives, assumptions, chosen test, post-hoc pairs.
- **StatsTile assumptions captions clarified** — "Shapiro-Wilk test for normality" / "Levene (Brown-Forsythe) test for equal variance"; cells show bare values instead of duplicated headers.
- **Bargraph Long/Wide CSV buttons** use the same compact green style.
- **Bargraph chart SVG** uses natural width capped at `100%` instead of stretching edge-to-edge on small datasets.
- **Tool pages** have `min-width: 1100px` so narrow viewports get a horizontal scrollbar instead of breaking layout.
- **Stats summary embedded in SVG** — when Show-on-plot is active, a grey monospace block (test, post-hoc pairs, effect size, n) renders below the legend and is included in SVG/PNG exports.
- **Aequorin plot page restructured** — collapsible time-course tile + single Integral tile with a Raw / Baseline-corrected toggle, per-replicate CSV, and StatsTile. Replaces the dual-barplot layout.
- **Aequorin barplot controls decluttered** — removed Width, Height, X/Y label size, stroke opacity, stroke width; color pickers simplified to fill-only.
- **Calculator tool mobile-friendly** — removes the 1100 px min-width and stacks vertically below 600 px.
- **Merged bargraph into Group Plot** — box/violin/raincloud/bar picked from one dropdown. `bargraph.html` becomes a redirect shim.
- **Power table shows α = 0.05, 0.01, 0.001** — on-screen and in the TXT report.
- **Significance brackets show all pairs** with non-significant labelled "ns".
- **Example dataset balanced** for a mix of significant / non-significant comparisons.
- **Power primitives moved into `stats.js`** — single home for all numeric code. All 217 power tests still pass.

### Removed

- **Bargraph remnants** — `bargraph.tsx`, `bargraph.html`, the `bargraph` icon, `?style=bar` URL handling. Merge into Group Plot complete.

### Fixed

- **Power tool ANOVA n-solver jumped to 100000** for large effect sizes at k ≥ 6 — root cause was `ncf_sf` truncating its Poisson mixture at a fixed ±500-step window. Now widens to ±8σ with a `pUp < 1e-14` early exit and a normal-approx short-circuit for λ > 1000.
- **`gammainc` silently wrong at large `a`** — series loop had a fixed 200-iter cap; at a ≈ 10000 it needs ~780. Scaled the cap with √a. Propagated into `chi2cdf` and large-df F-tails.
- **`ncchi2cdf` truncated Poisson mixture** — same fix as `ncf_sf`: √(halfLam) window + early exit + normal-approx far tail.
- **`BracketPair` missing `pAdj`** in `types/globals.d.ts`.
- **Unused `maxW` parameter** in `renderStatsSummary`.
- **Unused aequorin `insetStrokeColors` props**.
- **Filter panel missing checkboxes** for numeric columns when the user explicitly assigned them a `filter` or `text` role.
- **Calculator tool mobile scrolling** — added `overflow-y: auto` + touch scroll on body; last result tile reachable.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Landing page shows real git version** — derived from `git describe --tags` via a build-time script writing `tools/version.js`. Between-tag commits show as `v1.1.0-3-gabcdef`.

### Fixed

- **`kde()` mean-in-reduce bug** — precompute the mean before the variance reduce; bandwidth selection was O(n²) and violin/raincloud on ~10k points hung for seconds. Output unchanged.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Source maps** alongside compiled `tools/*.js` for debuggable stack traces.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** following Keep a Changelog.
- **Error boundary around every tool's root `<App />`** — readable fallback with copyable technical details and reload button, replacing the previous blank-screen crash mode.

### Changed

- **CI and deploy run on Node.js 22** with `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` opt-in ahead of GitHub's June 2026 Node 20 deprecation.
- **`ColorInput` accepts 3-digit hex** (`#abc` → `#aabbcc`) and normalises to lowercase 6-digit.
- **README trimmed** to a single overview table; per-tool walkthroughs now live in each tool's How-to panel.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-11

First tracked release. Baseline of features shipped to GitHub Pages prior to the introduction of this changelog.

### Added

- Landing page with iframe-loaded tools and vendor prefetch progress bar.
- Shared utilities (`tools/shared.js`) and plain-JS React components (`tools/shared-components.js`).
- CSV/TSV parsing with auto-separator detection and decimal-comma fix.
- SVG / PNG / CSV export from every chart tool.
- Boxplot violin and raincloud plot styles.
- Scatter regression line with stats overlay.
- TypeScript compile-time checking across tool sources (`npm run typecheck`).
- ESLint + Prettier configuration and GitHub Actions CI workflow.
- Minified esbuild output for production bundles.
- Custom test harness with tests across shared utilities, parsing, components, and power calculators.
